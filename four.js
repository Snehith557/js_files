// DOM AND DOM MANIPULATION
// three musketeetrs of web development
// HTML     CSS     JS
// SKELETON DESIGN  LOGIC
// DOM      document object model
// we can access all the elements that are written in the html by js
// i.e browser creates the DOM of the webpage
// all the code in html is converted into an object form in javascript that object 
// is called the document which belongs to window
// so document is an sub object of the window
// console.dir()    is used to print the objects

// document is the model representation of the html called DOM
// each element in the html is called a node and is an object

// NOTE 
// the reason that the script is loaded in the last of the body is that
// to get all the elements
// if we load the script in the begining of the body or in the head all the html data elements that come 
// after the script will not be accesable

// console.dir(document.body.childNodes[5])
// console.dir(document.body.childNodes) gives all the elements that are present in the body field

// console.log(document.getelementby(id class tag others))
