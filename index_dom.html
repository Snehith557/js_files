<!-- the basic structure of an html page -->
<!-- will contain head and body  -->
<!-- head mostly contains all the external imports title something like these files -->
<!-- body contains all the tags the are used for content  -->

<!-- script is written just at the end of the body good practice -->

<!-- NOTE NOTE NOTE -->
<!-- for every window the browser creates one object called window 
which basically represents that window which has some methods associated 
with that object -->
<!-- all the methods like alert prompt console.log belongs to that object -->
